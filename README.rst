This is the source code for slides to my talk about the
`Mozilla Apps Project`_.

`View the slides on github`_.

I've given this talk at various developer meetups but
the info might be outdated by the time you read this.
If you checked out the code and want to build the slides yourself,
these commands will do it::

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python build.py mozilla-apps-talk.txt
